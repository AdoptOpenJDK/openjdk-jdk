/**
 * Dump a class file for a class on the class path in the current directory, or
 * in the specified JAR file. This class is usually used when you build a class
 * from a test library, but want to use this class in a sub-process.
 *
 * For example, to build the following library class:
 * test/lib/sun/hotspot/WhiteBox.java
 *
 * You would use the following tags:
 *
 * @library /test/lib
 * @build sun.hotspot.WhiteBox
 *
 * JTREG would build the class file under
 * ${JTWork}/classes/test/lib/sun/hotspot/WhiteBox.class
 *
 * With you run your main test class using "@run main MyMainClass", JTREG would setup the
 * -classpath to include "${JTWork}/classes/test/lib/", so MyMainClass would be able to
 * load the WhiteBox class.
 *
 * However, if you run a sub process, and do not wish to use the exact same -classpath,
 * You can use ClassFileInstaller to ensure that WhiteBox is available in the current
 * directory of your test:
 *
 * @run driver ClassFileInstaller sun.hotspot.WhiteBox
 *
 * Or, you can use the -jar option to store the class in the specified JAR file. If a relative
 * path name is given, the JAR file would be relative to the current directory of
 *
 * @run driver ClassFileInstaller -jar myjar.jar sun.hotspot.WhiteBox
 *
 * @deprecated use {@link jdk.test.lib.helpers.ClassFileInstaller} instead
