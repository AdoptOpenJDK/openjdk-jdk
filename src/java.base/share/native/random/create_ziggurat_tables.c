// This program computes the parameters and arrays needed by the modified-ziggurat algorithm
// for sampling from either an exponential distribution with mean 1 or a normal distribution
// with mean 0 and standad deviation 1.  The four arrays needed for either kind of sampler are:
//
//    X[i] is the horizontal width of ziggurat layer i
//    Y[i] is f(X[i]), where f is the function for the exponential or normal curve
//    alias_threshold is the table of probability mass thresholds for Walker's alias method,
//       with one entry for the tail of the distributon and one entry for each overhang region
//    alias_map is the table of forwarding indices used for Walker's alias method
//
// The four parameters needed by the exponential sampler are:
//
//    exponential_number_of_layers   the number of layers in the ziggurat
//    exponential_X_0                the width of the box in layer 0 (which is the x-coordinate of the left end of the tail)
//    exponential_convex_margin      the maximum discrepancy between the curve and a certain diagonal line above it
//
// The five parameters needed by the normal sampler are:
//
//    normal_number_of_layers        the number of layers in the ziggurat
//    normal_X_0                     the width of the box in layer 0 (which is the x-coordinate of the left end of the tail)
//    normal_inflection_index        the index of the layer containing the inflection point
//    normal_convex_margin           the maximum discrepancy between the curve and a certain diagonal line above it
//    normal_concave_margin          the maximum discrepancy between the curve and a certain diagonal line below it
//
// After computing the parameters and tables, the program prints (to standard output)
// a complete Java source code file for a class named either FloatZigguratTables or
// DoubleZigguratTables, according to which precision has been requested.

// The only reason this program has been written as C code rather than Java code is that
// most of the calculations need to be performed in long double precision in order to
// be able to calculate double values of sufficient accuracy.  This code relies on
// long double math functions sqrtl, powl, expl, logl, log2l, erfl, ceill, and copysignl.

// The overall modified ziggurat algorithm closely follows the description in:
//
//     Christopher D. McFarland.  2016 (published online 24 Jun 2015).  A modified ziggurat
//     algorithm for generating exponentially and normally distributed pseudorandom numbers.
//     Journal of Statistical Computation and Simulation 86 (7), pages 1281-1294.
//     https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00949655.2015.1060234
//     Also at https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.6870 (26 March 2014).
//
// This paper in turn refers to code available at https://bitbucket.org/cdmcfarland/fast_prng.
// This includes a file create_layers.py of Python code for constructing the tables.
// The C code here loosely follows the organization of that Python code.  However, the Python
// code appears to contain a number of errors and infelicities that have been corrected here:
//
// (1) On line 211, 1 is added to i_inflection, causing the value 205 to be printed when
//     table size is 256.  Adding 1 is not correct; the correct value for printing is 204.
//
// (2) On line 203, 3 values are dropped from the front of the array E when computing iE_max,
//     with no explanation given.  We believe this is incorrect; E[3:] should be simply E.
//
// (3) When the table elements are converted to printable strings using "map(str,data)",
//     precision is lost because the Python str function produces only 12 decimal digits.
//     In this C code, we print table entries using 17 decimal digits (format %23.16e),
//     because 17 decimal digits suffice to preserve the value of any double precision
//     value (and 16 decimal digits do not always suffice).
//
// (4) At lines 215-223, the Python code computes only a single E value for the
//     rectangle containing the inflection point of the normal distribution curve.
//     We believe it is conceptually more correct to compute two such E values,
//     one for the concave part of the curve (to the left of the inflection point)
//     and one for the convex part of the curve (to the right of the inflection point).
//
// We also observe that the McFarland paper asserts that the solver uses Brent's method,
// but the solver in the Python code does not implement Brent's method.  A proper
// implementation of Brent's method (or its predecessor, Dekker's method) alternates
// between use of the Secant Method and use of the Bisection Method according to various
// criteria, but the Python code merely tries the Secant Method for a fixed number of
// iterations and then switches to the Bisection Method for a calculated number of iterations.
// Here we have translated Brent's Method into C from the Algol code in Brent's original paper.
